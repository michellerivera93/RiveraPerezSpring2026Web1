    <p> Hi! My name’s Michelle Rivera Perez and I am a sophomore at Hunter College majoring in Media Studies. I grew up in Sunset Park, Brooklyn in a Mexican household and I hope to work in marketing after college. My hobbies include: videography, journaling, and learning new languages. I hope to serve my community in some way through my work.
