    <h3>Mundaneum, Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine</h3>
    <p>The Mundaneum was an early project created by Belgian thinker Paul Otlet to organize all the world’s knowledge. The work began in 1895 when Otlet and Henri La Fontaine founded the International Institute of Bibliography. The Mundaneum itself was proposed in 1910 as a central place for information. It used the Universal Decimal Classification system and stored millions of index cards with data about books, articles, and images. Otlet later described a system for remote access to information in 1934, which anticipated the modern internet.</p>

    <h3>1960s, Project Xanadu “hypertext”, Ted Nelson</h3>
    <p>In the 1960s, Ted Nelson started Project Xanadu. He introduced the idea of hypertext, which allows text to link to other text. His goal was to create a system where information stayed connected and sources were always credited. This idea later shaped how links work on the web.</p>

    <h3>1960s The Birth of the Internet ARPANET</h3>
    <p>In the 1960s, the U.S. Department of Defense developed ARPANET. It connected computers at different universities. The goal was to share data and keep communication working during outages. ARPANET became the basis of the modern internet.</p>

    <h3>First Email Ray Tomlinson 1971</h3>
    <p>In 1971, Ray Tomlinson sent the first email between networked computers. He chose the @ symbol to separate the user name from the host machine. Email quickly became one of the most widely used internet services.</p>

    <h3>Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP) Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn 1983</h3>
    <p>On January 1, 1983, ARPANET officially switched to TCP/IP, the set of communication rules developed by Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn. This transition allowed many separate networks to interconnect as a single “internet.” The TCP/IP standard laid the foundation for how data travels across the modern internet.</p>

    <h3>Invention of the World Wide Web Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau at the European Council for Nuclear Research (CERN) 1989</h3>
    <p>Tim Berners‑Lee invented the World Wide Web while at CERN, submitting his proposal on March 12, 1989 to link documents across networks. He worked with Robert Cailliau to refine the idea into a hypertext‑based information system. The Web added a user‑friendly, linked layer on top of the existing internet.</p>

    <h3>Foundations of a website URL /HTTP/HTML/BROWSER Tim Berners-Lee 1990</h3>

    <p>By December 1990, Tim Berners‑Lee had developed the key technologies of the Web: HTML (webpages), HTTP (transfer protocol), URLs (addresses), and the first web browser/editor. These technologies defined how websites are built and accessed. They became the core structure of all web pages.</p>

    <h3>First Website Tim Berners-Lee 1991</h3>
    <p>The first website went online at CERN on August 6, 1991. It explained the World Wide Web project and how to use the new system. This site marked the Web’s public beginning.</p>

    <h3>The First Search Engine Alan Emtage Archie index 1990</h3>
    <p>Archie, created by Alan Emtage and released on September 10, 1990, was the first tool to index and search files on FTP servers. Archie let users find specific files rather than browse manually. It’s considered the first internet search engine.</p>

    <h3> The First Photo on the Internet Tim Berners-Lee 1992</h3>
    <p>On July 18, 1992, a photo of the parody band Les Horribles Cernettes was uploaded to the World Wide Web at CERN, becoming the earliest widely recognized image on the Web. The photo showed the Web’s ability to handle more than text. This event was an early step toward multimedia online.</p>

    <h3>The Invention of Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 WIFI standard 1997</h3>
    <p>In 1997, the IEEE 802.11 standard was published, defining the first set of rules for wireless local‑area networking, later known as Wi‑Fi. It allowed devices to connect to networks without cables. This standard made wireless internet communication widely possible.</p>
